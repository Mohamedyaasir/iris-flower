The objective of this task is to develop a machine learning classification model using the Iris flower dataset to accurately identify and classify Iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known and widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning, making it ideal for understanding and implementing fundamental classification techniques. In this task, the dataset consists of four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species labels. The process begins with data exploration and preprocessing to understand feature distributions, detect patterns, and ensure data quality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps visualize relationships between measurements and species, highlighting how different features contribute to class separation. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model’s generalization ability. Various machine learning classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines (SVM), can be implemented using Python libraries like scikit-learn. The model is trained on the labeled data to learn the distinguishing characteristics of each Iris species. Model performance is then assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to measure classification effectiveness. The task emphasizes understanding feature importance, algorithm selection, and model evaluation in supervised learning. By successfully completing this task, one gains practical experience in building, training, and evaluating classification models, as well as insights into how machine learning can be applied to real-world biological data for accurate pattern recognition and decision-making.
